# Music Controller

## 💡 Inspiration

In an attempt to further my web development skills I took it upon myself to learn django and react and what better to do that than following a project tutorial! Music is also one of my favorite passtimes because of its ability to alter our emotions. So why not mix music with web dev! 

## 💻 What it does

- Create a "music" room which will generate a unique code.
- That code becomes shareable and you can send it to your friends to join!
- Users can then join the room via the shareable code and view what song the host is streaming.
- As the app is connected with spotify, the users who join the room will automatically have their spotify adjust to the host's current jam session!

## 🔨 How we built it

We started by creating the basics of the REST Api. 
This meant creating functions that will be able to create the rooms, edit the rooms, join the rooms, and delete the rooms (all of this in django. 
From there we went on to the react framework where we created components for all the different pages that we were supposed to have. 
Then there was the spotify api integration where we had to deal with the login of users as well as all the functions to play, pause, and skip the song. 
Finally, we peiced everything together and :lightning: voila :lightning:

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
One of the bigger challenges was React as it was a harder because it was my very first time using it, so it took some time to get accustomed to.

Another challenge we ran into was the good ol' spotify API. Sadly, they only extend a multitude of their API functions to users with premmium accounts which meant our project only extends to spotify premium users :(
## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud of the fact that I was able to launch the entire project as it was my first time building a large scale django-react app.

## 📖 What we learned

I learned a lot about frontend dev with React and Material-UI. I also learned a lot about the spotify API.

## 🔜 What's next for _music-controller_

Next I want to make this platform available for all spotify users and maybe add a few more features (which I have not decided on).
